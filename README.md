### Techology used
The project is done using React in the frontend part. And thanks to all the libraries that react has, we decided to work with `syncfusion` library. With this tool, we are able to design schedules, make calendars, kanban, charts and much more. with this library, we were able to do the 97% of frontend. The other libraries like `react-icons` and `three js` are the sumplementary of the whole frontend part.

And second of all, we have the `tailwindcss` library that we are using to make css more compilable and dynamic using classes. You can check its documentation at its official website [here]('tailwindcss.com)

We decided to use `Vite` in order to quickly run this project along side with `npm`. Vite is one of the latest solution used by react for node package management.
If you want to learn more about vite, you can vite, you can check thier documentation.
